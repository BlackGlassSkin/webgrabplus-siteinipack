You will need curl for Windows:  https://curl.haxx.se/windows/

Download it, and copy the files from the bin folder to the WG++ working folder.
This is the folder containing the Webgrab++.config.xml file

(If you are using linux, I still have to test it on linux)  
But the process should be indentical.  Except curl is provided by default on linux machines.
